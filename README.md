# online-shop
Basic backend for an online shop.

The project is built using Docker Compose and works with the MySQL database. The project API provides basic methods for buying and tracking products, writing reviews, working with user carts and so on. This project is *not intended for production*, but rather conceived as an example of using Django, Django Rest Framework and Docker technologies.
